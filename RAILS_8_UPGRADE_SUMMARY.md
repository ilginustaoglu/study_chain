## How to Use After Upgrade

### Development Server
Start the development server with CSS compilation:
```bash
bin/dev
```

Or manually in separate terminals:
```bash
# Terminal 1
rails server

# Terminal 2
bin/rails dartsass:watch
```

### Installing New JavaScript Libraries
Use importmap to pin JavaScript libraries:
```bash
bin/importmap pin library-name
```

### Asset Compilation for Production
```bash
rails assets:precompile
```

### Database Migrations
All existing migrations are compatible and working:
```bash
rails db:migrate
```

## Breaking Changes to Watch For

### JavaScript
1. **Turbolinks → Turbo**: Event names changed
   - `turbolinks:load` → `turbo:load`
   - `turbolinks:before-cache` → `turbo:before-cache`
   
2. **Rails UJS**: Now part of Turbo, no need to explicitly start it

3. **Import Syntax**: Use ES6 imports instead of require
   ```javascript
   // Old (Webpacker)
   import Rails from "@rails/ujs"
   
   // New (Importmap)
   import "@hotwired/turbo-rails"
   ```

### Forms
- Devise forms now work with Turbo out of the box
- Remote forms use `data-turbo-stream` instead of `remote: true`

### CSS
- SCSS files are now compiled with Dart Sass
- Watch mode runs via `bin/rails dartsass:watch`

## Verification Steps

✅ Ruby 3.2.2 installed and active
✅ All gems installed successfully (101 gems)
✅ Database migrations are all up and running
✅ Importmap configuration created
✅ Turbo and Stimulus installed
✅ Asset pipeline configured
✅ Devise configured for Turbo compatibility
✅ Development server scripts created

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Application**: Start the development server and test all features
   ```bash
   bin/dev
   ```

2. **Check for Deprecation Warnings**: Run the app and watch for any deprecation notices

3. **Update Tests**: If you have test files, update any JavaScript-related tests

4. **Review Custom JavaScript**: Check any custom JavaScript for Turbolinks references

5. **Production Deployment**: When ready, deploy with:
   ```bash
   rails assets:precompile RAILS_ENV=production
   ```
